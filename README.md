# **RECESSION EDA AND VISUALIZATION**

### INTRODUCTION:
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization on the US Recession dataset. The aim is to uncover key insights and trends related to the economic downturn periods in the US.

### DESCRIPTION:
- Unnamed: 0 - Index column (likely added automatically during saving). Can be ignored or dropped.
  
- Price_x - Likely represents a normalized or scaled price of a key economic asset (e.g., S&P 500 or some financial index).
  
- GDP (Gross Domestic Product) - The total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually annually or quarterly.
  
- Industrial Production Index(INDPRO) – A measure of real output for all facilities in the industrial sector (mining, manufacturing, and utilities).
  
- Consumer Price Index(CPI) – Measures the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for goods and services (inflation indicator).
  
- 3 Mo to 30 Yr - These columns represent Treasury yield rates for various maturities.
3 Mo, 4 Mo, 6 Mo, 1 Yr, ... 30 Yr.
These show the interest rates on U.S. government bonds and help indicate market expectations of economic performance.

- Rate - Likely refers to the Federal Funds Rate or some composite interest rate, indicating the cost of borrowing.4

- BBK_Index - Possibly the BBK Financial Conditions Index, which assesses financial stability based on various economic indicators.

- Housing_Index - A measure of housing market health, such as home prices or housing starts (normalized).

- Recession - Binary flag: 1 indicates a recession period; 0 means no recession. This is the target variable.

### Summary of insights:

This analysis provided valuable insights into the economic patterns surrounding recession periods in the United States. By exploring key indicators such as GDP, CPI, industrial production, housing index, and treasury yields, I was able to observe how these variables fluctuate during times of economic downturn. The visualizations helped in clearly identifying trends and correlations that signal recession phases. Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of macroeconomic data, improved my data analysis and visualization skills in Python, and deepened my awareness of how economic indicators are interconnected during recessions.
